# Milestone 6 - Refactoring Report

**Team members:Benjamin Lau, Noah Sugden and Bingqing Teng

**Github team/repo:Gothrothiml


## Plan
1. Add some comments in all files in the Snarl game
2. Refactor rulechecker/gamestate input to use less hashmaps
3. If we lose points in future graded milestones, we will refactor our code to reflect the necessary changes.


## Changes
We updated 14 files with 664 additions and 44 deletions.
We finished all the commenting in the files in src folder, deleted a few unused functions in the Level class and in the GameState class,and added some constraints in GameManager.


## Future Work
We still need to refactor rulechecker/gamestate input to use less hashmaps.
We lost some point in our GameManger design for not checking duplicate usernames, therefore we need to change it in our GameManager class.



## Conclusion
In the refactoring process, we didn't aim to change any function; However, as we were writing comments, we found out a few flaws.
Milestone6 took us about 5 hours in total.
