The games are played in sequence(a game starts after the previous one finished).
After each game is finished, a leaderboard will be sent to the player.
The leaderboard is ranked by the player's accumulated scores.
In each game, the player's score = the number of keys picked up + the number of exits - the number of ejects.
Only the player's usernames will be sent to the player.
After each game is finished, the administrator needs to input a line in the console to start a new game.
After a new game is started, the player updates will be sent to the players, and the players will be asked to take moves right away.
The line can be anything, but if it is "exit", the server will shut down and disconnect from the clients.
